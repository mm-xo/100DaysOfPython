# 100DaysOfPython

Following along https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/.

My whole purpose in taking this course and following along day by day is so I can strengthen
my Python foundations and learn to build new things. 
The project-based learning approach implemented in this course is my preferred way to master Python and build a job-ready skillset.

#### Challenges that I face in every project will be commented on in the project files.

## My Learnings:

### Day 1 (Band Name Generator)
This project required me to use `print` statements as well as `input` to get user input. There was also a minor application of formatted string.
